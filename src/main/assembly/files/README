Brooklyn Waratek
================

Entities and sample code to allow Brooklyn to deploy and manage the Waratek
CloudVM for multi-tenant virualized Java.

# Getting Started

The `start.sh` script requires a location named `waratek` to have been
configured in the `brooklyn.properties` file, or you can specify an
alternative using the `--location` option. The example application
can be started as follows:

    % ./start.sh launch

This will launch the `SimpleJavaApplication` class, which is a Brooklyn
application that launches a `WaratekJavaApp` configured to use the
provided `brooklyn-waratek-examples.jar` library. It starts a single
JVM with a single JVC by default, running the `com.example.HelloWorld`
example application class, which uses 64KiB of heap memory every second.

The *Sensors* tab on the Brooklyn console for the application shows the
total number of deployed JVMs and JVCs as well as their combined heap
usage. If Brooklyn is configured with credentials for AWS or another
location with multiple VMs available, the JVM and JVC clusters can be
resized to start further copies of the configured Java application.

To build a more complex application it is suggested that the CAMP YAML
format is used to define the blueprint for Brooklyn. There are two
sample files provided that can be started from the command-line as
follows:

    % ./start.sh application --yaml simple-http-application.yaml
    % ./start.sh application --yaml simple-java-application.yaml

Further documentation on the CAMP YAML extensions supported by Brooklyn
is available [online](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/).
